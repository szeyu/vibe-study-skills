## Problem-Solving Patterns

### Stoichiometry Problems

1. **Write balanced equation**
2. **Convert given to moles** (using molar mass or molarity)
3. **Use mole ratio** from balanced equation
4. **Convert to requested units**

### pH Calculations

| Type | Formula |
|------|---------|
| Strong acid | pH = -log[H⁺] |
| Strong base | pOH = -log[OH⁻], pH = 14 - pOH |
| Weak acid | pH = ½(pKa - log C) |
| Buffer | pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]) |

### Redox Balancing (Acidic Solution)

1. Separate into half-reactions
2. Balance atoms except O and H
3. Balance O with H₂O
4. Balance H with H⁺
5. Balance charge with e⁻
6. Multiply to equalize electrons
7. Add half-reactions

| (aq) | Aqueous solution |
| (s) | Solid |
| (l) | Liquid |
| (g) | Gas |
| ⇌ | Reversible reaction |
| → | Forward reaction |
| Δ | Heat applied |
| ↑ | Gas evolved |
| ↓ | Precipitate formed |

## Lewis Structure Steps

1. Count total valence electrons
2. Draw skeleton structure (central atom)
3. Place bonding pairs
4. Distribute remaining electrons as lone pairs
5. Check octets (or duets for H)
6. Form multiple bonds if needed
